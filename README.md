## Project 1: Video Special Effects
The objective is to work with the OpenCV package and the 
mechanics of opening, capturing, manipulating, and writing 
images. This report displays the results of running several 
effects on a video stream, such as blurs, color filters, and 
more. This report aims to provide an overview of these 
filtering techniques and discussing their real-time video 
processing capabilities. 

## Project 2: Content-Based Image Retrieval
The objective is to work with a large database of images and to 
find images in within the database that are similar to the target image. 
The purpose of this project is to learn how to manipulate and analyze 
images at the pixel level. We will be using classic features and deep 
network embeddings to extract features and recognize patterns. 

## Project 3: Real-Time 2D Object Recognition 
The objective of this project is to develop code to allow a 
computer to identify a specified set of objects placed on a white 
surface. The computer should be able to recognize single objects 
placed in the video frame regardless of translation, scale, and 
rotation. It should also be able to recognize these objects in real-time. 

## Project 4: Calibration and Augmented Reality 
This project aims to describe how to calibrate a camera using 
OpenCV and to display how to use the calibration to generate virtual 
objects within the scene. The result is a program that can detect a 
target and place an object in a scene relative to that target’s 
movement. Additionally, features were added such as detecting 
multiple robust features, hiding the chessboard target, image 
distortion correction, and a point cloud using DepthAnything. 

## Project 5: Recognition Using Deep Networks
This project will demonstrate how to build, train, and modify a 
deep neural network for image recognition tasks using the MNIST 
digit dataset. It will showcase the step-by-step process of creating a 
network, optimizing it for better performance, and analyzing its 
behavior. Additionally, it will highlight the effectiveness of deep 
learning models in recognizing patterns and solving classification 
problems, even with relatively simple datasets and basic hardware. 
Through this, the project will provide a clear and practical 
understanding of the core principles of deep learning.

## Final Project: Implementation of An Efficient Coverage Method for Irregularly Shaped Terrains with Lunar Terrain
Mapping the Moon’s surface is challenging due to 
its irregular shapes and features like craters. This paper 
introduces an efficient method for covering lunar terrains. It 
uses a neural network to detect craters accurately and combines 
this with smart algorithms for effective mapping. The result is 
better coverage with less effort, improving accuracy and 
efficiency for future lunar missions.
